# Why should you use Julia?

> The best language for scientific computing.

1. It is fast.
2. It is **very fast**.
3. You don't need C/C++, Fortran, or other "slow-productivity"/"slow-prototyping" language.
   This is known as the "two-language problem".
4. It has a friendly syntax.
5. Very easy to install (you don't need a C++ toolchain like others programming languages).
6. Support for Unicode and $\LaTeX$ characters.
   No more `alpha` and `beta`; hello to `α` and `β`.
7. Easy to add and prototype new algorithms that are fast straight from the gun.
8. Great project management and reproducible environments baked into the standard library.
